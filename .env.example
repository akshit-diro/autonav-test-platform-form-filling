# Frontend runtime config (Vite). All optional; safe defaults apply when missing.
# Copy to .env and override as needed.

# --- Stress / automation ---
# Artificial delay (ms) after UI actions (preset click, calendar select). 0 = disabled.
# VITE_UI_DELAY_MS=0
# After date selection, some dates become disabled (true/false).

# Show loading spinner before Download becomes enabled (true/false).

# --- Session / timeouts ---
# Logout after this many ms of no activity.

# Show warning this many ms before logout.
# VITE_WARNING_BEFORE_LOGOUT_MS=15000
# Session idle timeout (ms). Used by inactivity guard.
# VITE_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=120000
# Session warning (ms) before logout.

# --- Auth flow variant ---
# simple (default) | otp-simulated (OTP step blocks until verified) | reauth-on-sensitive-action (reauth before PDF download).
# VITE_AUTH_FLOW_VARIANT=simple

# --- UX delays (bank-style latency) ---
# Disable download button for this long (ms) after date selection changes.
# VITE_DISABLE_DOWNLOAD_AFTER_SELECTION_MS=400
# Show spinner for this long (ms) before starting PDF generation.
# VITE_SPINNER_BEFORE_PDF_MS=600

# --- Bank theme ---
# bank_a = top-nav, "Download PDF" (default). bank_b = sidebar, "Get Statement".
# VITE_BANK_THEME=bank_a

# --- DOM noise (simulate real bank page complexity) ---
# none (default) | low | medium | high. Deterministic; never blocks happy path.
# VITE_DOM_NOISE_LEVEL=none

# --- Date picker isolation (selected scenarios only: Presets, From-To, Dual Calendar, Inline Calendar) ---
# When true, date picker renders inside a shadow root.
# VITE_USE_SHADOW_DOM=false
# When true, date picker renders inside an iframe. If both are true, iframe wins.
# VITE_USE_IFRAME_PICKER=false

# --- Keyboard and focus quirks (real bank UX patterns; do not fully block keyboard users) ---
# Tab cycles inside modal; Enter in modal (non-day) closes; preset then focus moves to Download.
# VITE_ENABLE_KEYBOARD_TRAPS=false
# Focus jumps back to first field when validation error appears.
# VITE_FOCUS_RESET_ON_ERROR=false

# --- Date localization ---
# DATE_FORMAT: DD/MM/YYYY | MM/DD/YYYY | YYYY-MM-DD (default).
# VITE_DATE_FORMAT=YYYY-MM-DD
# LOCALE: en-IN | en-US | en-GB (month/weekday names).
# VITE_LOCALE=en-GB
# WEEK_START: Sunday | Monday (calendar first column).
# VITE_WEEK_START=Monday

# --- Bank-style UX anti-patterns (increase decision ambiguity; flow remains completable) ---
# When true: validation only after blur, error messages dismiss after 3s, disabled buttons have no tooltip, required fields not marked clearly.
# VITE_ENABLE_ANTI_PATTERNS=false

# --- Cross-scenario state leakage (realistic; resettable via logout) ---
# When true: previous date range pre-filled, cached calendar month, last-used account remembered.
# VITE_ENABLE_STATE_LEAKAGE=false

# --- Chaos level (0–3; deterministic per session; never blocks completion) ---
# 0=off. 1+: randomize mount order, reorder DOM siblings, timing variance, equivalent UI paths.
# VITE_CHAOS_LEVEL=0
